                <h2 class="subpage_headings greenTextColor">Volunteer As A Judge</h2>
                <p>Over 100 judges are needed for our annual ISEF affiliated science fair, the BCA Research Expo taking place at the Bergen County Academies on Sunday, March 1, 2020, from 9am until noon.   Experts from all fields of science, technology, engineering, and math are needed, not only to help judge the exhibits, but also to interact with students. Those who judge at science fairs describe the experience as challenging, but one of the most rewarding experiences, as you have the ability to motivate the next generation of young innovators. Therefore, participating as a judge is critically important to the success of the BCA Research Expo as well as enhancing the learning experience for the participating students. Judges can request disciplines to evaluate and should be knowledgeable in the field chosen.</p><p>
As a judge you will be tasked with assessing parameters of a science project such as creativity, experimental design and use of the scientific method, data collection and analysis, interpretation of results and the potential impact of the topic investigated. In addition, you will also be asked to critique the student’s level of understanding of their research as well as their presentation skills.   There will be multiple “judgings” for each project so there should be no concern about your point allocations being consistent with the other judges. Please <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeY66sSO6rDCs8iaglbZTEVWLATKTwhPvx8Kt8FLbhd5ICXSA/viewform" title="Judge Sign-up" target="_blank">click here to sign up</a> for what is promised to be a very rewarding experience as you “give back” for those that inspired you!<a class="forSmallDevices" href="#">Top of page</a></p>

				  <p>Volunteers are needed to support our annual ISEF affiliated fair, the BCA Research Expo taking place at the Bergen County Academies on Sunday, March 1, 2020, from 9am until noon.  Those who volunteer describe the experience as rewarding as you have the ability to interact and motivate the next generation of young innovators. WE NEED YOU to make this experience a long lasting memory for the research students from the Bergen County Academies.  Assistance with any portion of the fair itinerary will be greatly appreciated.</p><p>
Volunteers are critical to the success of this endeavor. You do not need to be knowledgeable about science to be helpful. With many students, judges and guests at this event, we will need help with registration, building logistics, snack distribution and more. We will contact you with your assignment and provide you with all the information you will need to help this day run smoothly. All you will need to bring is your friendly, helpful self.  If you would like to be a part of this exciting event in its inaugural year, please <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1a4YbW92ff3EDxybl335_7Y8Q2Mh7D-GIs3mN8cltPKM/edit?ts=5a1de99d" title="Volunteer Sign-up" target="_blank">click here to sign up</a>.<a class="forSmallDevices" href="#">Top of page</a></p>
