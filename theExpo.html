            <h2 class="subpage_headings greenTextColor" id="news">Research Expo News</h2>
            <p>Each year, more than 7 million high school students around the world, develop original research projects and present their work at local science competitions with the hope of
				making it to the Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair, a program of the Society for Science
				&amp; the Public. Approximately 1,700 winners of local, regional, state, and national competitions are
				invited to participate in this week-long celebration of science, technology, engineering, and math. At
				the event, these young innovators share ideas, showcase cutting-edge research, and compete for more than
				9 million dollars in awards and scholarships.</p>
            
            <p>We are very excited to be hosting our own ISEF affiliated science fair and we count on your cooperation
                and support in getting all materials returned to school in a timely manner. If you have any questions,
                please reach out to your child’s mentor or to my office at any time.

            <h2 class="subpage_headings greenTextColor" id="faq">Research Expo FAQs</h2>
            <p><span class="faqQuestion">If I enter the Research Expo in the category of “Novice Researcher,” and decide
                    I want to compete for “Local prizes” in February, can I appeal my category?</span><br>You and your
                mentor may appeal the change to the SRC.</p>

            <p><span class="faqQuestion">I have been working on my project for 2 years, how am I ever going to fit all
                    of that data on my poster?</span><br>
                According to ISEF rules, you are not permitted to display data collected prior to May, 2024. The ISEF
                rules state only one year’s data may be displayed.</p>

            <p><span class="faqQuestion">Should my mentors name be on my poster?</span><br>No only your name can appear
                on the poster.</p>

            <p><span class="faqQuestion">Does the Research Expo follow ISEF rules?</span><br>Yes, as the rules change
                from year to year, the forms change as well. Also, the link provided will assist in answering some
                additional questions which may arise regarding rules. <a

            <!-- <p><span class="faqQuestion">If the SRC determines my paperwork needs some corrections, will I be
                    disqualified because it is now after November 25?</span><br>
                No paperwork must be submitted by November 25 with local SRC signature already in place (who will submit
                it to the regional SRC on November 25), but modifications can be made until December 13.</p> -->

            <p><span class="faqQuestion">Does the Research Expo follow ISEF rules?</span><br>Yes, the Research Expo
                follows ISEF rules as this is required in order to have the affiliation. ISEF rules can be found at <a
                    href="https://student.societyforscience.org/international-rules-pre-college-science-research">
                    https://student.societyforscience.org/international-rules-pre-college-science-research</a></p>
            <p>Only rules specific to date of the fair or times and questions about electricity availability may be
                different. Please consult with your mentor.</p>

            <p><span class="faqQuestion">If I have a specific question my mentor cannot answer who should I
                    contact?</span><br>You can email researchexpo@bergen.org</p>

            <p><span class="faqQuestion">What if I do not finish all of the work I described in my research
                    plan?</span><br>Do not be concerned, frequently students do not complete all of the work they
                describe in the plan.</p>

            <!-- <p><span class="faqQuestion">Can I add new assays or experiments to my project following final SRC approval
                    (no later than Dec. 13)?</span><br>No</p> -->

            <p><span class="faqQuestion">Will the ISEF Finalists come from different categories?</span><br>No, not
                necessarily.<a class="forSmallDevices" href="#">Top of page</a></p>
